A new Flutter project. to be our final project in BIU university in the department of computer science.


About Med.io
We- Dean Zion, Simo Bitton & Tomer Yona created this project as part of our Final Project for BS.c. in Computer Science at Bar Ilan University

The Problem
Ever since COVID-19, we’ve noticed a surge in home hospitalized patients. This has revealed huge technological gaps in communication and management of treatment processes between health care provider s and patients. Moreover, the measurement of vital signs is subjective and initiated by the human factor. On the medical team’s side, the monitoring of the home hospitalized patients is done manually and therefore isn’t prioritized effectively. Due to insufficient tracking of vitals, patients fall between the cracks and this may cost them the ultimate price - life.

The Solution
By analysing the problem, we have learned that there is importance in connecting between patients and healthcare providers seamlessly. Our solution is a mobile app for patients that collects vital signs from smart wristbands/watches and analyzes data about the patient’s breathing with help of their mobile phone’s integrated camera. On the other end, health care providers are able to track, monitor and analyze patients’ vital signs & overall health by using a smart dashboard that displays relevant data and helps the medical team prioritize and make life & death decisions in real time based on objective vital signs. By doing so, the treatment patients receive is faster and more-reliable.
